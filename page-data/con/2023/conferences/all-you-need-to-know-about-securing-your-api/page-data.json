Should I use good old sessions or API tokens ? Which kind of tokens? How long should they live? Refreshed or blocklisted? And what about Authorization? Do I need OAuth? Which flow? Shall I use Roles or Voters? Maybe both? Also, how can I scope resources to the authenticated user? </p>\n<p>This talk will give you the keys to determine <strong>how to secure each part of <em>your</em> API within API Platform</strong>, according to their business rules and the state-of-the-art.</p>","type":"conference","speakers":"-robin-chalas","track":null,"start":null,"end":null,"date":null,"short":"Get the best practices for securing your API","title":"All you need to know about securing your API (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)","edition":2023}},"staticQueryHashes":["2760183193","3395815452"]}
